# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive, full-stack application designed to simulate the development of a **robust booking platform, much like Airbnb**. It serves as a practical, real-world exercise focused on mastering modern software development practices, complex system architectures, and collaborative team dynamics.

The application will feature core booking functionalities, user authentication, property listing management, and a secure API for all transactions. It emphasizes **scalability, security, and maintainable code** throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- **Implement a scalable backend architecture** capable of handling numerous user requests and data transactions.
- **Design a normalized and efficient relational database** structure for managing users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
- **Develop a secure and well-documented RESTful API** for seamless client-server communication.
- **Master collaborative development workflows** using GitHub for version control and team coordination.
- **Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline** to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies will be utilized to build and deploy the Airbnb Clone:

| Component             | Technology              | Rationale                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Framework** | **Django** (Python)     | Chosen for its "batteries-included" approach, robust security features, and built-in ORM, accelerating secure API development. |
| **Database**          | **MySQL**               | Selected for its reliability, performance, and maturity as a transactional relational database management system.              |
| **API**               | **GraphQL** (over REST) | To provide clients with the ability to request exactly the data they need, enhancing performance and reducing over-fetching.   |
| **Containerization**  | **Docker**              | For consistent and portable development, testing, and production environments.                                                 |
| **CI/CD**             | **GitHub Actions**      | To automate the build, test, and deployment phases, ensuring code quality and rapid iteration.                                 |
| **Documentation**     | **Markdown**            | For clear and comprehensive project documentation.                                                                             |
